      <h2>Mathematical Fireworks</h2>
      While exploring Mandelbrot sequence trajectories, you may have noticed some pretty transitions
      as you slowly move the cursor over the complex plane. The most striking spectacles can be found
      just outside at the edge of the Mandelbrot set. Some of these 'animations' that result from displaying 
      trajectories of adjacent points c in quick succession reminded me of fireworks, so that's
      what I will call them from now on.

      <h2>Creating a Fireworks Display</h2>
      The tool on the left can be used to define 'routes' of $c$ over the complex plane that will be traced
      to create fireworks. A route is created by simply clicking on the complex plane to create waypoints.
      Once you are happy with a route, you can click on 'Save Firework' and define more routes.
      When you're happy with the saved routes, you can click on 'Start Show' for the tracing of all routes
      to begin simultaneously. <br> <br>
      You can use the escape iterations indicator on the top left to check whether the current point $c$ you're hovering
      on is likely within the Mandelbrot set (i.e. if it is equal to the max iterations parameter\). The most intricate animations
      and the ones I consider fireworks are found outside of the Mandelbrot set, but very close to its edge. The routes don't have to be
      long! In fact, some of the nicest animations I have been able to achieve by defining very short routes just outside the edge.
