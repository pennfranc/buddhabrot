      <h2>About the Trajectories</h2>
      The overall shape and intricate details of Buddhabrot arise thanks to the trajectories of points $c$ that
      tend towards infinity (and before their magnitude starts to increase exponentially\) of the Mandelbrot equation
      $$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c,\quad z_0=0$$
      
      This prompts the question of
      what kinds of trajectories we get for different values of $c$. The tool on the left lets you explore not only trajectories going
      to infinity, but also converging or oscillating ones. $c$ is wherever the mouse points. The number of points displayed for each trajectory
      The Mandelbrot set is indicated roughly by by the dark red dots.
      The number on the top left indicates how many iterations $n$ of the Mandelbrot equation
      are necessary for $|z_n|>2$ up until $n=\text{max iterations}$. We get $n=\text{max iterations}$ if the sequence
      does not diverge or if $|z_n|>2$ only for $n>\text{max iterations}$. The length of the trajectory displayed is always
      equal to $n$.
