      The <b>Mandelbrot Set</b> is defined as the set of complex numbers $c$
      for which the following sequence does not tend to infinity as $n$
      increases for $z_0=0$.
      $$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$
      When rendering an image of the Mandelbrot Set, in addition to coloring all points within the set,
      diverging points are colored according to how many iterations are necessary for them to exceed a certain absolute value.
      For instance, in the following image pixels are colored according to how many iterations are required such that $|z_n| > 10^3$.
      Each color transition corresponds to one additional iteration.

      While this technique already results in endlessly intricate patterns, it throws away a lot of the complexity that arises from the Mandelbrot sequence, namely
      the trajectories of $z_n$ for a given $c$.
      <h2>Buddhabrot</h2>
      Unlike the Mandelbrot Set, Buddhabrot does not refer to a set, or any clearly defined mathematical
      structure for that matter (although potentially it could be formalized as some kind of distribution\).
      Instead, it refers to a kind of algorithmic/mathematical painting technique parametrized by <i>max escape iterations</i> and 
      <i>min escape iterations</i>.
